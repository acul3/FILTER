# FILTER: An Enhanced Fusion Method for Cross-lingual Language Understanding

This is the official repository of [FILTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05166).

## Requirements
We provide Docker image for easier reproduction. Please use `dockers/Dockerfile` or pull image directly.
```bash
docker pull studyfang/multilingual:xtreme
```

To run docker without sudo permission, please refer this documentation [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
Then, you could start docker, e.g.
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it -v /path/to/FILTER:/ssd -it studyfang/multilingual:xtreme bash
```

## Quick Start

**NOTE**: Please make sure you have set up the environment correctly. 

1. Download raw data and our preprocessed data. 

Please set your `DATA_ROOT` in init.sh, and then run the following command to download all data and our pretrained models.
```bash
bash scripts/download_data.sh
```

2. Evaluate our pretrained models which are save in `$DATA_ROOT/outputs/phase${idx}/${task}` :
```bash
bash eval.sh -t ${task} -n phase${idx}/${task}
```

where 
- `idx` could be `1` (without self-teaching) or `2`(+ self-teaching).
- `$task` is the name of the task to evaluate from (`[xnli, pawsx, mlqa, tydiqa, xquad, udpos, panx]`)

## Model Training
We use translated training data for QA from XTREME team. Please refere to their [repo](https://github.com/google-research/xtreme) or their [translation](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/xtreme_translations) directly.

Once your data is ready, simply run the following command to train a FILTER model for supported XTREME tasks:
```bash
bash train.sh -t ${task} -n ${task}_k${k}_m${m}_ -x "--filter_k ${k} --filter_m ${m}"
```

where 
- `$task` is the name of the task to train from (`[xnli, pawsx, mlqa, tydiqa, xquad, udpos, panx]`)
- `k` is the number of fusion layers
- `m` is the number of local layers

The output model will be save into `${DATA_ROOT}/outputs/${task}_k${k}_m${m}`.
**Note that we ran experiments on 8 V100 GPUs for FILTER models. You may need to increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` if you have less GPUs.**
